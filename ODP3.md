# Installation
## connect to GPU before running the cells. 
> [!WARNING]
>  You can get free access to the GPU for a limited time.

> [!NOTE]
> **according to my experience**, the limited time is ~ 3-4 hrs. Though the limit changes dynamically. But it'll be accessable again after 22-24 hrs.

> [!TIP]
> When you don't need to run cells, try to stay disconnected. You can still edit the cells while remaining disconnected.
