# Installation
## connect to GPU before running the cells. 
> [!WARNING]
>  You can get free access to the GPU for a limited time.

> [!NOTE]
> **according to my experience**, the limited time is ~ 3-4 hrs. Though the limit changes dynamically. But it'll be accessable again after 22-24 hrs.

> [!TIP]
> try to stay disconnected when you don't want to run cells. You can edit cells by staying disconnected.
