## **Things to be kept in our mind**
1. Everyone have to update the main files only after any valid improvement is achieved in the code. Before that they should work with their files normally in local machines. 
2. After updating this repo with updated files, the commimt message should be " <short_description_of_the_recent_updade> ".
3. Then have to update the " Changelog.md " file (available in repo) by adding a new entry containing 'things updated'/ 'fixed things','your name','date'.
  like: ``` |  < things updated/fix > | <Details of the Update/fix >        |07.08.2024| ```
