## **Things to be kept in our mind**
1. Everyone have to update the main files only after any valid improvement is achieved in the code. Before that they should work with their files normally in local / remote machines. 
2. After updating this repo with updated files, the commimt message should be " <slno-of-change_date> "   <br> like: ```4_07082024```
3. Then have to update the " Changelog.md " file (available in repo) by adding a new entry containing 'Sl.no.','things updated /fixed','your name','Details of the Update/fix','date'.  <br> Like:
   ```
    |<sl no>|  < things updated/fix > |<Your_name >| <Details of the Update/fix >        |07.08.2024| 
  
  <br>
*your'e most welcome for any suggestion*
