## **Things to be kept in our mind**
1. Everyone have to update the main files only after any valid improvement is achieved in the code. Before that they should work with their files normally in local / remote machines. 
2. After updating this repo with updated files, the commimt message should be " <slno_date-of-change> " like: `1_07082024`
3. Then have to update the " [Changelog.md](https://github.com/superguine/ODProject/blob/main/Changelog.md) " file in case of major update (eg: adding section, fixing bug)) by adding a new entry containing 'Sl.no.','things updated /fixed','your name','Details of the Update/fix','date','Commit message'. Like:

``` 
| <sl_no> | <things updated/fix> | <Your_name > | <Details of the Update/fix > | <Date> | <Commit message> |
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> DO NOT update the Changelog for fixes like typing mistake,decoration etc. For those cases maintain same commit message.
